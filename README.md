FHSD: Finger Hypercubes Sanitization with Demographics

Introduction: 
Finger Hypercubes Sanitization with Demographics (FHSD) dataset was introduced in ICPR 2022 paper. 

“A Novel Demographic-based  Time-Series Database of Finger Hypercubes before and after Hand Sanitization”, ICPR 2022 

FHSD is a demographic based time series database of finger hypercubes collected before and after hand sanitization. It is developed to enable the monitoring of the biochemical spectra from the finger skin, to analyze the intra-class variability and the demographic bias. 
For each subject, six hypercubes (3 per finger) are collected from the left and right index fingers before the hand sanitizer is applied. Once the hand sanitizer is applied, each fingerprint instance is collected three times after 1, 10, and 25 minutes resulting in a total of 24 hypercubes collected from each subject. Hence, this dataset comprises 600 hypercubes collected before sanitization and 1800 hypercubes from both the fingers after hand sanitization. Therefore, this dataset comprises a total of 2400 hypercubes collected from 100 subjects, and the total time taken for each subject during the data acquisition is 45 minutes.

In this data collection, each finger hyperube at an instance is collected three times to better understand the spectral variations at each instance. To study demographic biases, the demographic data was also collected from the subjects via an in-person paper survey. For this collection, we used Purell hand sanitizer containing 70% ethanol, manufactured by GOJO, and subjects applied a single pump of hand sanitizer, approximately 3 ml of this product once the six hypercubes were collected before hand sanitization. Few sample examples of the hypercubes collected before and after hand sanitization are as follows,
